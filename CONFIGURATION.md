# Configuration

Config file is read from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inori/config.toml`,
defaulting to `$HOME/.config/inori/config.toml` if it is not set.

## Keybindings

### Keybinding sets

inori comes with sensible default keybindings for some commands. It
also includes two extra sets for convenience to hopefully suit most
users.

To enable the dvorak set, use

```toml
dvorak_keybindings = true
```

and likewise, to enable the qwerty set, use

```toml
qwerty_keybindings = true
```

Note that if both are set to true, the option set last will shadow the
option set first.

In general, the dvorak set will be more familiar to emacs users (this
is what I personally use), and the qwerty set will be familiar to vim
users.

### Keybinding syntax

Keybindings set in the config file _override_ the defaults if they are
set, but do not delete them.

Keybindings should be defined in a toml table called `keybindings` like
so:

```toml
[keybindings]
command1 = "KEYSTR1"
command2 = "KEYSTR2"
```

where a `"KEYSTR"` describes a keybinding with the following format that
will be reminiscent to emacs users:

```
KEYSTR := <KEYBIND> <KEYSTR> | ""
KEYBIND := <MODIFIER><CHARACTER>
MODIFIER := C- | M- | S- | C-M- | ""
CHARACTER := char | <SPECIAL_KEY>
SPECIAL_KEY := <space>
  | <tab>
  | <esc>
  | <backspace>
  | <delete>
  | <up>
  | <down>
  | <left>
  | <right>
  | <enter>
  | <home>
  | <end>
```

Each of the modifiers corresponds to a modifier key, `CTRL, META,
SUPER, CTRL+META`. So, your keybindings will look like `g g` or `C-c
C-n` or `C-<space>`

Note that you can specify multiple entries for each command, creating
multiple keybinds.

Note that the dvorak/qwerty sets _do not_ delete the default
keybindings.

## Theme

Colors should be specified in a table called "theme", like this:

```toml
[theme.item_to_color]
fg = COLOR
bg = COLOR
add_modifier = MODIFIERS
sub_modifier = MODIFIERS
```

All fields are optional. `COLOR` should be **a string** of either

- rgb hex: "#FF0000"
- [ansi escape index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit): "9"
- ansi color code: "White", "Red", "LightCyan", etc

`MODIFIERS` should be a string of "\<MODIFIER\>" joined by "|"
characters. The available modifiers are

- BOLD
- DIM
- ITALIC
- UNDERLINED
- SLOW_BLINK
- RAPID_BLINK
- REVERSED
- HIDDEN
- CROSSED_OUT

For example, you might write `add_modifier = "BOLD | ITALIC"`.

Here is the full list of styles available for customization:

| Name                      | Explanation                                    |
